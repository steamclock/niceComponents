     *  - weight: The font weight the font should be. Default is `nil`. TODO: Should this just be regular or something? Need to figure out where it's applied
     *  - tracking: The space between the characters.
     *  - dynamicTypeMaxSize: The maximum dynamic type size the font should be scaled to. Default is `nil`, meaning the font will scale to the maximum allowed by iOS.
